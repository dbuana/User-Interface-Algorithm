# The algorithm is considerably simple, in terms of concept. The concept is a user creates their
# own number array and then the program tries to arrange the numbers. 

# Inside/Analyzing: I have included the user-interface by simply using the input method, in addition
# I added a "for loop". For the purpose of validating each numbers present in the array. 
# With that; the result should be the numbers listed, in order.
