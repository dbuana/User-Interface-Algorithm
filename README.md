# User-Interface-Algorithm
This program uses user-interface and arrays. The objective is that the user creates an array, in an unorganized order. Then, the program arranges the array. 

In addition, this program used recurssion to pursue its objective on arranging user's array. 

Recurssion Process(It may be inaccurate, but I am still learning) :

1). Created the user-interface along with it's commodities. A whole function is dedicated on creating the user-interface. 

2). Each user-input has a variable dedicated towards them. It may not be the most efficient way but it executes, just fine. 

3). Another function is dedicated into creating the "array organizer". It also includes a "for loop" in order to make a constant validation.
